# AVL-Tree-Insertion
A Java program to insert nodes in AVL tree

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a program to implement AVL insert.

Use the algorithm discussed in the class to create AVL tree. Insert at least 15 nodes in random order.

After all the nodes are inserted, print the left and the right height of the last node inserted (should be 0). Go all the way to the root to print left and right height.

>> Java version : 9.0.1

>> IDE used: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2017.3

>> Build and run the class file "AVLTreeInsert.java"
	- It will insert the elements in the AVL tree and then print the left and right heights of the last inserted node all the way till the root.
	- The root node of the created tree can be verified from the pre-order traversal of the tree which will be printed next.

>> Output screenshot is present in the folder 'output screenshot'
>> Also created an AVL tree with the same elements from tree simulator from 'https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html' to verify our output.
>> A screenshot of the tree is also saved in the same folder for reference.
>> Verified that the code is getting successfully complied and run by command line.

>> Note: The values in this program are directly passed in the main function, we can easily tweak the program to take the input from the user to make this more dynamic.
